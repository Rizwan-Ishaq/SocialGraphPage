We have chosen to dig into the vast world of great thinkers throughout history. Our motivation is to learn more about the thinkers and the ideas that have helped shape how the world and the cultures in it have evolved. We are interested in, how the sentiment of philosophy has evolved over time. Whether is has notably evolved a all. If it in, one way or another, correlates with renowned periods history, and maybe even whether philosophers are a driving force in the development of society or whether they are mere products of their time representing the contemporary ideas.

In addition to that we will look at how, the philosophers have influenced one another throughout time - and whether mutual influence have created anachronical _communities_ in the history of philosophy.
